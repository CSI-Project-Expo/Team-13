# Do4U 🚀

### An AI‑Powered Hyperlocal Favour Exchange Platform

Do4U is a full‑stack web application that enables users to request short‑term favours (tasks) and connect with verified helpers called _Genies_. The platform focuses on **trust, fair pricing, and safe task execution**, using AI-assisted pricing and a transparent job lifecycle.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

People often need quick, local help for everyday tasks such as pet walking, household chores, or academic assistance. Existing platforms lack a secure, transparent, and intelligent system for hyperlocal, short-duration tasks involving strangers. Do4U addresses this gap by combining **AI-driven price suggestions**, **verified helpers**, and an **end-to-end task management workflow**.
